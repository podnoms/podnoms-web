<p>You may, if you wish, add your full name (assuming we have not been able to get this from a social login provider). This
    is only used for displaying a greeting in the website when you are logged in. You can change this to anything you want.

<p>In short - we collect the bare minimum, we don't really care who you are or what you are up to as long as you find this site
    useful.</p>
